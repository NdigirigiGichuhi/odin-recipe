	<h1>Ultimate Potato Soup</h1>
	<p>I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title. It takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)</p>

	<h2>Ingridients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 pound bacon, chopped
</li>
		<li>2 stalks celery, diced
</li>
		<li>1 onion, chopped
</li>
		<li>3 cloves garlic, minced
</li>
		<li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
</li>
		<li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes
</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons butter
</li>
		<li>¼ cup all-purpose flour
</li>
		<li>1 cup heavy cream
</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon
</li>
		<li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
</li>
		<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
	</ul>


	<h1>Directions</h1>
	<h1>Step 1</h1>
	<p>Gather all ingridients</p>

	<h1>Step 2</h1>
	<p>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</p>

	<h1>Step 3</h1>
	<p>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>

	<h1>Step 4</h1>
	<p>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

	<h1>Step 5</h1>
	<p>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. </p>

	<h1>Step 6</h1>
	<p>Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</p>

	<h1>Step 7</h1>
	<p>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</p>

	<h1>Step 8</h1>
	<p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
